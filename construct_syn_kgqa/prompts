Given one relation and its head or tail entities, please generate ten synthetic entities with same types as these entities.
These entities should do not exist in the real world, and they are used in my fictional novel.
You should output them in the format list.

Here are some examples:

Relation: location.imports_and_exports.exported_to
Entities: ["Angola", "Dubai", "Egypt", "Germany", "Nepal", "Sierra Leone", "Sudan", "United States of America"]
Output: ["Aruvia", "Zephyria", "Empyria", "Avalonia", "Verdania", "Galadria", "Elysium", "Aetheria", "Nirvana", "Aurora"]

Relation: sports.pro_sports_played.career_start
Entities: ["2002", "2004", "2005", "2007", "2014"]
Output: ["1998", "1980", "2023", "2000", "1949", "1840", "2050", "2077", "1988"]
